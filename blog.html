        <p class="topic"> Introduction / Read Me </p>
        <p>I recommend you read the guide from top to bottom.<br>
        <span class="comment">[But who does that? When an article on Medium says "6 min read" does it really take us 6 mins? Do we even read the whole thing?]</span> Sigh! Please ignore the grey text as much as possible.</p>
        <p>I've written this guide through first hand experience and hard work. I'll be as thorough as possible, in return all I ask is for you to make this your bible for 3C.</p>
        <p>The guide has been divided into sections which you can access directly through the tags provided above.<br><span class="comment">[As if it wasn't obvious but have to make a proper documentation, you know]</span></p>
        <p id="accommodation" class="topic"> Accommodation </p>
        <p>Short version: Take an Accommodation through University Living which gives you meals. Don't take a flat.</p>
        <p>The Accommodation that I lived at was located at Ladbroke Road, named "Bowden Court". It is a student accommodation which provides breakfast and dinner all through week days while breafast and lunch on weekends (elaborated in Food column). The room that I stayed in was a twin sharing with 2 single beds, 2 sets of cupboards, 2 sets of drawers (there are 3 drawers in each set, one of which has a lock), one mirror attached behind the door, a washbasin, a table, 2 chairs, a radiator and a window <span class="comment">(looked around) and a door</span>. The tapwater is drinkable and has running water 24/7 with both cold and warm water. The beds are provided with two pillows, a bedsheet and a comforter. In India, we use heaters to keep our houses warm, here, they use centralized heating using radiators. The heat from radiator can be adjusted using a knob and usually the room is really warm even though I keep the window open 24/7 for proper ventilation.<span class="comment"> I'm sitting here in a Tshirt and a hoodie while the temperature just outside the window is (I legit checked my phone) is 6 (degree symbol).</span> The room is spacious enough for two people. There are four floors on the building plus a ground floor and a basement. The rooms are more spacious on the 1st floor and the least on the 4th (IDK about the rooms on the ground floor). There are rooms for a single tenant as well (but I don't have any info on them).</p>
        <p>The food is available in the canteen on the basement. It's a pretty big canteen, more like a hostel-mess. The food is served as a buffet. It's a place to interact with other students <span class="comment"> and weirdos </span> in the accommodation. The timing and everything else is elaborated in the Food section <span class="comment">I could link the foo... [be quiet! be quiet! make a straight face] :)</span></p>
        <p>Additional facilities include a TV room (with really comfy sofas and beanbags), a microwave room, a gym, a laundary room and a study room (but I've never been there). The gym is meh! You get the basic machines but a lot of necessary ones are missing including the pulley. The dumbbells go upto 20kgs. (I bought a resistance band which gives upto 25kg of resistance and that worked out fine for me). Laundary costs 3.20£ for the washing machine and 0.20£ minimum for the dryer (you add more money to it to make it run longer). </span> Sh!t's expensive round here.</span> You can get print-outs taken at the accommodation itself, and that costs 0.25£ per page (I've merely started talking about expenses).</p>
        <p>There are about 8-10 toilets and showers each, on every floor (except basement). Shared toilets I thought would be a problem but aren't. They are usually empty (not because there are less people but becasue <span class="comment">[who cares!?]</span> I seriously don't know and ignorance is bliss). The toilets are neat and clean. They are cleaned daily.</p><p> I hope by now you understand why I asked you to not take a flat. The challenges with living in a flat shared among friends are nothing but doable. But you're not in India. You're in a foreign country where it takes 10£ to get two visa photos clicked. You don't want to face these challenges (of making your own food, cleaning the house (oh btw they clean the room every weekday and change the covers every two weeks, here), cleaning the bathrooms, cleaning the dishes, managing groceries, need i go on?). My advise, take a student accommodation, focus only on the things you need to do<span class="comment"> and not how you clean those</span> ;)</p>
        <p>I think that covers it all. If I missed something or you have a question, please do ask me.</p>

        <p></p>
