        <p class="topic"> Introduction / Read Me </p>
        <p>I recommend you read the guide from top to bottom.<br>
        <span class="comment">[But who does that? When an article on Medium says "6 min read" does it really take us 6 mins? Do we even read the whole thing?]</span> Sigh! Please ignore the grey text as much as possible.</p>
        <p>I've written this guide through first hand experience and hard work. I'll be as thorough as possible, in return all I ask is for you to make this your bible for 3C.</p>
        <p>The guide has been divided into sections which you can access directly through the tags provided above.<br><span class="comment">[As if it wasn't obvious but have to make a proper documentation, you know]</span></p>
        <p id="accommodation" class="topic"> Accommodation </p>
        <p>Short version: Take an Accommodation through University Living which gives you meals. Don't take a flat.</p>
        <p>The Accommodation that I lived at was located at Ladbroke Road, named "Bowden Court". I was assigned to it by a company called University Living which is like an AirBnB company but for students and it handles student accommodations. Bowden Court is a student accommodation which provides breakfast and dinner all through week days while breakfast and lunch on weekends (elaborated in Food column). The room that I stayed in was a twin sharing with 2 single beds, 2 sets of cupboards, 2 sets of drawers (there are 3 drawers in each set, one of which has a lock), one mirror attached behind the door, a washbasin, a table, 2 chairs, a radiator and a window <span class="comment">(looked around) and a door</span>. The tapwater is drinkable and has running water 24/7 with both cold and warm water. The beds are provided with two pillows, a bedsheet and a comforter. In India, we use heaters to keep our houses warm, here, they use centralized heating using radiators. The heat from radiator can be adjusted using a knob and usually the room is really warm even though I keep the window open 24/7 for proper ventilation.<span class="comment"> I'm sitting here in a Tshirt and a hoodie while the temperature just outside the window is (I legit checked my phone) is 6 (degree symbol).</span> The room is spacious enough for two people. There are four floors on the building plus a ground floor and a basement. The rooms are more spacious on the 1st floor and the least on the 4th (IDK about the rooms on the ground floor). There are rooms for a single tenant as well (but I don't have any info on them).</p>
        <p>The food is available in the canteen on the basement. It's a pretty big canteen, more like a hostel-mess. The food is served as a buffet. It's a place to interact with other students <span class="comment"> and weirdos </span> in the accommodation. The timing and everything else is elaborated in the Food section <span class="comment">I could link the foo... [be quiet! be quiet! make a straight face] :)</span></p>
        <p>You get a number of keys and "access device" (IDK what to call it exactly). You get a key for your room door, your drawer with lock and your cupboard. The access device helps you get into the accommodation, into the main access point of rooms and into the gym. I carry the set of keys everytime I step outside the room. <span class="comment"> Boy, is it fun when your roommate forgets the keys</span></p>
        <p>Additional facilities include a TV room (with really comfy sofas and beanbags), a microwave room, a gym, a laundry room and a study room (but I've never been there). The gym is meh! You get the basic machines but a lot of necessary ones are missing including the pulley. The dumbbells go upto 20kgs. (I bought a resistance band which gives upto 25kg of resistance and that worked out fine for me). Laundry costs 3.20£ for the washing machine and 0.20£ minimum for the dryer (you add more money to it to make it run longer). </span> Sh!t's expensive round here.</span> You can get print-outs taken at the accommodation itself, and that costs 0.25£ per page (I've merely started talking about expenses).</p>
        <p>There are about 8-10 toilets and showers each, on every floor (except basement). Shared toilets I thought would be a problem but aren't. They are usually empty (not because there are less people but because <span class="comment">[who cares!?]</span> I seriously don't know and ignorance is bliss). The toilets are neat and clean. They are cleaned daily.</p><p> I hope by now you understand why I asked you to not take a flat. The challenges with living in a flat shared among friends are nothing but doable. But you're not in India. You're in a foreign country where it takes 10£ to get two visa photos clicked. You don't want to face these challenges (of making your own food, cleaning the house (oh btw they clean the room every weekday and change the covers every two weeks, here), cleaning the bathrooms, cleaning the dishes, managing groceries, need i go on?). My advise, take a student accommodation, focus only on the things you need to do<span class="comment"> and not how you clean those</span> ;)</p>
        <p>I think that covers it all. If I missed something or you have a question, please do ask me.</p>
        <p id="birkbeck" class="topic"> Birkbeck University </p>
        <p>Short version: Birkbeck University is where you'll be studying at in London. It's a cool college. But I haven't been around it. </p>
        <p>The coolest thing about Birkbeck is that every Thursday there are food stalls in the middle of the campus under the name of Farmer's Market. You'll get the best desserts and cheeseburgers burgers there for good prices. Classes are usually on the 4th or 5th floor.</p>
        <p>Birkbeck University's classrooms are equiped with state-of-the-art hardware. And the rooms itself are very well designed. <span class="comment">IDK why I wrote this para</span></p>

            <p id="clothes" class="topic"> Clothes </p>
            <p>Short version: You've got two options, either you carry everything from India itself OR you only carry the basic necessities and buy the rest from London.</p>
            <center><img class="shoes" src="img/shoes.jpg" alt="yeet"></center>
            <p>I'm gonna start off with shoes. I carried 5 pair of shoes <span class="comment">[LOL]</span>: a pair of boots, a pair of black sneaks, a pair of white sneaks, a pair of football shoes(not in the picture) and crocs. It's my absolute need. You don't need any special shoes for London given the weather and all. Your daily wear are perfectly fine. The one pair of shoes that you most definitely need, is a pair of boots. EVERYONE in London wears boots. <span class="comment">and an overcoat.</span> I'm not saying go ahead, do what everyone else is doing, but I believe in the grace of presenting oneself in a way to settle into the environment you're in. And if you wonna look good, get a pair of boots, and my suggestion is to buy a pair from here itself. You can never go wrong with a pair of Chelsea boots.</p>
            <p>London gets cold. Really Cold. Get a jacket that keeps you warm in this weather. Now you can wait to come here and then buy from here but that's upto you. The one that I bought was from Decathlon with a proven guarentee to keep warm above -10°C. There have been days when I wore just a Tshirt and this jacket and it worked amazingly well in just above zero temperatures.</p>
            <center><img class="jacket" src="img/jacket.jpg" alt="yote"></center>
            <p>I'll list the other mandatory things that I'd recommend you to carry:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Warm Socks <p>Make sure you have really really warm wollen socks or your feet are gonna pay for it.</p></li>
              <li>Extra Pair of Undergarments <p>You'd rather have it and not need it than need it and not have it. (The person who gave this advice has been clearly listed in Credits.)</p></li>
              <li>A suit <p>Even if you don't get a chance to wear one, just wear one sometimes.</p></li>
              <li>Muffler <p>Carry a good warm muffler.</p></li>
              <li>Neck Warmer <span class="comment">V.V.V.IMP</span> <p><a href="https://bit.ly/2GmDiik">BUY THIS.</a> 5 of my colleagues bought the same after they saw me wear one. It's a muffler substitute but is much better.</p></li>
              <li>Extra Hankerchiefs</li><p></p>
              <li>Body Warmers <p>I'm not a fan of body warmers <span class="comment">they are UGLY AF</span> but they really help sometimes.</p></li>
              <li>GLOVES <p>DO YOU LIKE YOUR HANDS? Take gloves with you. REALLY INSULATED ones. (check Decathlon)</p></li>
            </ul>
            <center><img class="me" src="img/me.jpg" alt="me"></center>
            <p>I'm sure I would've missed something but I can't pinpoint. Please ask me add something if I missed.</p>
            <p id="college" class="topic"> College Classes </p>
            Short version:<span class="comment"> ...what classes?</span>
            <p>On a serious note, it's 10pm of 27th Jan 2019 (I landed here on 8th Jan 2019) and only a single class has happened so far. It's funny and cool when it happens in Amity, Noida, it's not so cool or funny as it happens here. My dad spent a fortune to send me here and is this how I'm supposed to pay back? <span class="comment">FCUK OFF AMITY, THIS IS NOT INDIA</span></p>
            <p id="firstly" class="topic"> Firstly, as you Land </p>
            <p>Short version: <span class="comment">This topic is the short version of itself :)</span></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Make sure your Matrix sim has been activated. It did get activated in my case but my mobile data didn't work as a result I was not able to book my own Uber. The help team from Matrix got it working two days later.</li>
              <li>Put on your warm clothes, don't catch cold the moment you land <span class="comment">you'll have plenty of time for that :)</span></li>
              <li>Call back home and let them know that you've safely landed.</li><p></p>
              <p>I'm not exactly sure why I created this. <span class="comment">might have had been drunk when I did lol.</span> If ya got questions related to this, please inform me.</p>
            </ul>
            <p id="event" class="topic"> Events in London </p>
            <p>Short version: The best way to make the most out of your program is to attend a LOT of events. The two major websites to look up events are:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>•<a href="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/"> EventBrite</a></li>
              <li>•<a href="https://www.meetup.com/"> MeetUp</a></li>
            </ul>
            <div class="row">
              <div class="col-lg-6">
                <img class="p-event" src="img/event1.jpg" alt="Uno-Event">
              </div>
              <div class="col-lg-6">
                <img class="p-event" src="img/event2.jpg" alt="Dos-Event">
              </div>
            </div>
            <p>People in London are active. I learnt this while I was browsing events in January. Some of the events happening in March had already been sold out. Same happened with a lot of events in January itself. So, I suggest you do your research much before your flight itself and book a tickets for all those events you would like to attend regardless you whether you actually attend them or not. The worst that can happen is that you don't go for an event and they blacklist you.</p>
            <p>The day I sat down to look up events is the day I booked tickets for like all three months of events and added all of them to google calendar, downloaded the google calendar app and place it on my phone's home screen<span class="comment">, my pretty litte phone screen which is shattered now.</span></p>
            <p>The sites mentioned above are the two primary websites I used to find pretty much everything. There are listing on the sites for almost every kind of event that possibly happens in London.</p>

            <p id="flight" class="topic"> Flight </p>
            <p>Short version: It doesn't matter which flight you travel via, make sure you get the best offer and try <b>not</b> to buy the whole round-trip tickets at once.</p>
            <p>I flew via Etihad Airways, booked the tickets using ClearTrip two months prior to the session start date. I only booked this one flight so far from Delhi to London. The flight I took was divided in three phases: 4 hour flight to Abu Dhabi, 2 hours of lay-over at Abu Dhabi airport and 8 hour flight to Heathrow Airport, London. The flights were smooth and food was good. There was no problem with the luggage. Etihad airways allowed me to put upto 45kgs weight in my check-in baggage and upto 7kgs in my cabin bag. Etihad Airways has an app which I used to prebook my seat 24 hours prior to the flight. I got my boarding pass in hand for the second flight right there, but had to visit the check-in desk at the Indian airport to send my bags in and manually collect the boarding pass for the first flight.</p>
            <p id="food" class="topic"> Food </p>
            <p>Short version: Eat the food in your accommodation whether you like it or not (it's a great saving tip, trust me). For the rest, read the full extract.</p>
            <p>For all weekday lunches and weekend dinners when the accommodation canteen is closed, I usually get food from supermarkets or more like superstores. The following are the list of stores that you will be going to, priority vise:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>Tesco Metro/ Tesco Express (Both are same, Express is smaller/local version)</li>
              <li>Sainsbury/ Sainsbury Local</li>
              <li>Waitrose</li>
              <li>Mark's n Spencer (MnS)</li>
            </ol>
            Tesco is amazing for something called a "Meal Deal" wherein you can choose three items (from a list of options irrespective of their prices) and you'd only have to pay 3£ for the combo. They have other great offers as well. During night times usually, they reduce prices of stuff as well.
            <p>I don't go to these stores everytime nor am I asking you to. But it's the best way to budget while having a lot of options. The second most important place you'll find in London is the McDonald's. Their cheeseburgers are a hungry man's paradise. McDonald's is one of the cheapest options as well amongst Subway, KFC, Burger King, etc which are priced in a very similar way but are much better than what you get in India. There's a lot Starbucks and Costa's here as well, along with a very successful chain here known as Pret A Manger. They have really good hot beverages.</p>
            <p>There are a lot of local cafes, pubs, restuarants around every corner. It's literally upto you to either like them or not. I've been to quite a few of them and I've loved some while some were just meh, money waste. </p>
            <p>I'll update this in the future.</p>
            <p id="football" class="topic"> Football </p>
            <p>Short version: Go watch matches at Wembly Stadium and stick a smile on your face for what you just got.</p>
            <p>There were days I didn't buy lunch in Amity <span class="comment">not because I was on a diet (that's another case)</span>. There were times I didn't buy stuff that I really wanted since a long time. I was doing this coz I was saving money for the time I'd be in London. I saved a lot. Especially, for football [tickets]. I had a mindset that I'd watch atleast 3 matches namely the Manchester Derby, a game at Emirates Stadium or Stamford Bridge and the UCL match of Manchester United and PSG. I landed here with such high hopes. I even told my Uber driver that I'll be going to watch these matches. I completely ignored his cynic remarks about it being hard to get tickets and them being expensive. I was so sure that I had saved enough, I'd be going for a match every weekend. And then I got the reality check.</p>
            <p>As I looked up the prices for the matches, my jaw dropped lower and lower. I wasn't expecting this. I had googled usual rates of matches which were supposed to be about 40-45£. Turns out, the match prices are primarily based on the stadium and secondly based on the teams that were playing. And also the kind of match ofc (Premier League, UCL, FA Cup, etc). The Manchester derby tickets started from 100£. Good matches at Emirates or Stamford Bridge cost atleast 80£. And to top it all of, the UCL match tickets for United vs PSG started from 300£. <span class="comment">FUKC ME SIDEWAYS!</span>.</p>
            <p>I'm going for Tottenham Hotspurs vs Leicester City at Wembly Stadium on 10th Feb. Since Wembly is a government maintained stadium, it costs much less. I got a middle row and middle column tickets for 30£ only (I bought tickets under the category of young adult. Basically if you're an adult but under 22 years of age, you get extra discount). Also, a point to note, make an account through the website of the Spurs much before you go for the match. When you create an account, you get a Client Reference Number, only through which your ticket would be booked.

            <p id="luggage" class="topic"> Luggage </p>
            <p>Short version: The weight of luggage you can carry depends on the airline you travel through. Etihad airways permits 45kgs of check-in baggage and 7kgs in handbag.</p>
            <p>The biggest question about packing for a very long trip is what to NOT take. So, my philosophy was simple. I asked myself "What all things will I regret NOT carrying" and I put those stuff in my bag first. I brought two big suitcases and one bagpack. My suitcases together weighed about 35kgs while my handbag weighed about 6kgs. The reason I left 10kgs of space off of my luggage is coz of the stuff I'll buy during my trip. If my luggage weighed even 1kgs more than the legal limit while coming back, I would either have to pay a large sum to extend the weight to be carried or I would have to throw some of my stuff away. A good way of packing for your trip is to mark those things in your checklist which you'd use and throw (like most of the toiletry stuff) or eatables. I knew the accessibility of food is convenient in London so I didn't carry a lot of food. I had 1 ready-to-eat meal for emergencies and 2 cup-noodles. Whilst a lot of my colleagues carried a lot of Indian sweets and ready-to-eats. Honestly, the one thing I don't want when I go out is "home-food". <span class="comment">I want cheeseburger and pork and proper english desserts and more is elaborated in Food xD</span></p>
            <p id="mandate" class="topic"> Mandatory Things To Carry </p>
            <p>Short version: <span class="comment">A list is the shortest version of a list. It's a goddamn list for godsake.</span></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Medicines.
                <p>Go to your doctor, get a list of medicines, buy all of those and carry them with you. London's healthcare system (NHS) is not as helpful to foreigners. You can't just walk into a drugstore and buy a medicine. You can't just call a doctor coz you are feeling feverish. Chances are you won't get sick, London is 1000 times cleaner than our "under development since 72 years, mother nation". The most that can happen is that you catch cold. Guess what, London is cold, almost everyone has a runny nose. My nose bled the first week I was here coz my nose is accustomed to the "full-of-dirt" air of India.</p></li>
              <li>Umbrella.</li>
              <li>Water Bottle.
              <p>I also carried a thermos. It fell and broke. It's not required though (warm water is readily available) but still. Sorry mum :'(</p></li>
              <li>Towel.</li>
              <li>A Notebook & Pen.
              <p><span class="comment">I cracked a laugh whilst my colleagues were buying a notebook and a pen.</span></p></li>
              <li>Moisturizer.
              <p>Your hands are gonna get dry a lot. As non-macho it may sound to not use a moisturizer, kindly, use one.</p></li>
              <li>Earphones.
              <p>I don't step outside my house without earphones, how would I survive without them in another country? I carried 2 pairs of earphones and my gaming headset which are base boosted for those times I need to really focus or zone out (you prolly say that you are better now, better now, I only say that 'cause you're not around, not around). <span class="comment">Sorry, where was I? </span></p></li>
              <li>Toilet Paper/Roll.
              <p>There are emergency situations where you might need toilet roll. And even if you don't need them, you can use those as tissues.</p></li>
              <li>An Extra Phone.
              <p>Worst case scenario, you lose a phone and you have to buy one here. Electronics are expensive here. Take an extra phone with you. <span class="comment">My dad gave me his old motorola and bought a new phone. Well played, father!</span></p></li>
              <p>Update (29th January 2019): I shattered the screen of my phone. Don't ask how.</p>
              <li>Carry US Visa Photographs.
              <p>Somehow, it slipped my mind and I wasn't able to carry US visa photos. I wear glasses and for US visa, your photo needs to be without glasses. I went to about 5 photo studios and called another 5. The minimum price was offered by Royal Mail service shop and it costed me 10£ for 2 photos of 5cm x 5cm dimension. "10£". 1000Rs for 2 <span class="comment">fkin' </span>photos. I paid for it through my savings :/</p></li>
              <li>A Matrix Sim Card.
              <p>I forbid everyone reading this to travel without a matrix sim card. I paid 1500Rs, I got unlimited local (London) calling and SMS, 5Gb of monthly data (which is hardly used as there is free WiFi nearly everywhere) and 1000 minutes of calling to India. I wasn't that surprised as you guys might not be. But compared to almost all my colleagues who paid 15£ and got 500 minutes of local calling and a lot less mobile data, I was having the best condescending laugh of the time.</p></li>
              <li>Powerbank.
              <p>If you are a methodical person like me then you charge your phone everytime you enter your room. But if you are not, then carry a powerbank. Your phone is the most important asset beside your passport. Keep it alive everytime. Sadly, I bought a powerbank off of my pocket money and it's just lying in my drawer now coz I charge my phone periodically. <span class="comment">Sigh! Selling powerbank 50gp, also buying rune 2h sword and some lobster.</span></p></li>
              <li>Laptop.
              <p>I had a debate with myself about whether to put this in the list or not. Like who would be this dumb to forget the goddamn laptop at home. But then again, I'm a special snowflake whose name is usually taken in the same line as the word "exception", so well, here we are. Forgot to grey this out, lol.</p></li>

              <li>Camden Lock Market: The only market I remember going to from 10 years ago. It's the place for "cheap" stuff and not-so-cheap clothes. But the food there is a worth every pence while the artsy shops there are a must-go. </li><p></p>

            <p id="travel" class="topic"> Travel in London </p>
            <p>Short version: The cheapest means of traveling in London is walking. Followed by bus, underground (metro), Uber, Black Taxi, <span class="comment">Fake Taxi,</span> in the respective order.</p>
            <p>You will be walking a lot <span class="comment">unless you're rich</span>.The first time I was going to travel through the Underground (that's that they call the metro here <span class="comment">coz apparently it's underground. like woah. I'm sure the guy who named it would be drunk talking to his mate like "oi lad, what shuuwe name tha train below us?", 'you mean the train underground?', "UNDAGROUND!!"</span>). <span class="comment">[sorry]</span> The first time I was going to travel in the underground, I didn't have the Oyster card (I'll get to it in a bit). So, I check the ticket price to the station I wanted to go to and it was 4.90£. One way. I was like "nope". Got an Oyster card made.</p>
            <p>Oyster Card, is basically your Indian metro card but it works on buses here as well. You deposit a security for the card, get it topped up and use it in Underground stations and buses. The price for the Underground varies on the how far you're traveling just like in Delhi but it's not exactly the same. So, basically London is divided into zones. The innermost/central part of London is Zone 1 (my accommodation is in Zone 1). As you go outwards, the Zone number increases. I guess there are 5 or 6 Zones but seriously you won't ever be going there. Zone 3 is the most I've gone so far and it was a loooong way. London is huge. If you go across multiple zones, then you're charged more. I'll attach a photo of the prices down below. You can get Oyster card made from local general stores or more conveniently at the underground stations itself.</p>
            <p>The reason I have mentioned buses so far along with Underground is coz you'll be traveling more in buses than Underground if you want to save money. So everytime you go in the Underground, the minimum charge is 2.50£. Everytime you go in bus, it's about 1-1.50£. Buses are fast af as well. And I'm talking about the double storey London buses. These buses go fast af. Everytime you board a bus, you present your card, just like you present it at the Underground gates.</p>
            <p>Now the question of navigating through London and Underground/Bus routes. GOOGLE MAPS. This thing will save your life. It has everthing. It even shows how much time the next bus will arrive in. Download offline map of London as well. Also, keep your Location enabled at all point of time. Enable your data saver so background apps dont use off your mobile data but keep Location enabled. I keep my bluetooth enabled as well as it's readily connected to my watch, and if my phone were to go farther than a specific distance, my watch signals me that.</p>
            <p>Now, I've merely travelled once in a local bus in India so I can't make comparisons. Here, there are designated bus stops corresponding to a number of buses. For, example the NottingHill Gate bus stop B, has 4 buses which arrive to it. Which buses are arriving to the particular stop is written on the board next to the bus stop seats along with a route map for those buses as well. If you're using Google Maps, you'll get everything there precisely.</p>
            <p>A Hack I found: So when you're choosing a destination on Google Maps and then looking up directions to it from your location, go to the metro/Underground tab, press options and then you'll have the choice to select mode of transportation from Train/Bus/Tram. I usually select bus at this point and then the map only shows me the bus routes available.</p>

            <p>Visa process for UK was a big deal since our invite letters had been delayed. I received my invite letter on the 10th of December 2018 while my flight was for 8th January. Literally everyone said that the visa takes atleast 15 "working days" to process and December is a month with a lot of holidays so it's better to get be on the safe side, pay extra and apply for an express visa (which costs 12k INR more). I didn't go for the express and eventually I found out EVERYONE else was wrong. But I didn't know that on 7th December when I was hurriedly filling up my visa form. A form that was suppsed to take 45-60mins is something I filled in 20mins <span class="comment">somehow, lol</span>.Got my appointment scheduled for the 11th in the first slot at 8am. 11th was Monday, my visa arrived on Friday. Only I know how excruciating those few days in between were. There was no certainty about when my visa would arrive. But yeah, the visa took 5 days to process.</p>
            <p>So, the way it works for UK visa is that an agency by the name of "VFS Global" does the document collection process for the UK embassy. So when you apply for the UK visa, you fill the form through VFS Global and this organisation is solely responsible for collecting your documents and getting you the stamp on your passport. You get a list of documents that you need to present after you fill the visa form. But you need to make a folder for the same documents much before as these documents are responsible for getting you your invite letter from Birkbeck university. Invite letter basically states the details of the program you'll be attending, along with your name and other details. It's one of the most important documents. The document list that Amity asks is what the picture above shows. There is no interview process for UK visa, just biometrics and document collection. The Regular fee for the UK visa is about 9K INR, while the express fee is 22K INR. Urgent 1 day Visas can be done for about 1Lac INR.</p>
            <p>US visa process is one of the most hyped things about the 3C program. Now, I don't know how it goes out in India but the process that took place in London, for all of us, was honestly, futile. They literally knew every detail about us since a law firm had been asked by the Adelphi (the university you'll be going to in the US) University's administration to brief the embassy about the 3C program. Most of us had to just say "yes" to verify the information that they were stating. What was supposed to be an interview turned out to be a general conversation, only thing missing was a cup of beer :) <span class="comment">beer > coffee</span>. A list of the documents asked by Amity for the invite letter has been attached as the image above.</p>
            <p>You can't apply for the US visa before you apply for the UK one since you're going to UK first and then US. I was unable to apply for the US visa in India itself coz of insufficient time. But, now that I retrospect, I could've. Although I believe the process that took place here in London was much easier than what would've gone down in India. The fee structure for the US visa is bad. There's something called <a href="https://www.ice.gov/sevis">SEVIS</a>. In a nutshell you have to pay a fee to the Department of Homeland Security to go through your details, check your background, etc., known as the SEVIS Fee. SEVIS Fee is 180$. Then the visa fee is separate which is 160$. So, basically you have to pay about 23K INR for the US visa <span class="comment">which is kinda shitty.</span>. The visa that you will be getting is a J1 visa.</p>
            <p>Funny/Real story: Whilst I was waiting in line for the women affront to accomplish her interview, I could do nothing but eavesdrop. She was from an Italian origin, working under an American company in the States (obviously). For non-residents of the US, one needs a proper American contract to get a visa. This woman, did not have a proper one but she had been granted visas in the past and had traveled to the States (of America) a lot of times. As her visa was rejected due to an improper American contract she started protesting [I looked at the young man behind me and gasped "looks like we're gonna be here all day", to which he replied "IKR"] which lasted for about 10 minutes post which she gave up. As she turned around and was about to leave, she looked at me, smiled and said (and I quote), "Good luck with her". Referencing to the woman who took her interview. Contrary to her interview, mine went smoothly and I was done in under 2 mins. 2 mins. Done. Approved. US Visa. <span class="comment">YAY Viva la USofA!!wootwoot</span>. [While leaving I looked at the same guy behind me and literally we both said the following in chorus, "that was quick!", LOL.]</p>

            <p>London weather is unpredictable. Sun shines, it rains, it drizzles, it snows, sun shines, there's an overcast without rain, and repeat. The rain is such a bad <span class="comment">bitch</span>,that you can't figure out which direction it is coming from as it changes direction every other minute. It doesn't snow as much as one would imagine in London. I was under the impression that there'd be proper knee-level snow but no, that doesn't happen around here while the snowfall that does happen, is a beauty in itself</p>
            <p>[insert picture here] [if you click on my instagram link and follow me, a photo will appear here]</p>
            <p>London is mostly really really cold from January to March. Temperature can go as high as 12[degree]C or can go as low as -2[degree]C in some cases. So, make sure you have an all-weather jacket, a really warm overcoat and an umbrella at almost all times.</p>
