        <p class="topic"> Introduction / Read Me </p>
        <p>I recommend you read the guide from top to bottom.<br>
        <span class="comment">[But who does that? When an article on Medium says "6 min read" does it really take us 6 mins? Do we even read the whole thing?]</span> Sigh! Please ignore the grey text as much as possible.</p>
        <p>I've written this guide through first hand experience and hard work. I'll be as thorough as possible, in return all I ask is for you to make this your bible for 3C.</p>
        <p>The guide has been divided into section which you can access directly through the tags provided above <br><span class="comment">[As if it wasn't obvious but have to make a proper documentation, you know]</span></p>
        <p class="topic"> Accommodation </p>
        <p>Short version: Take an Accommodation through University Living which gives you meals.</p>
        <p>The Accommodation that I lived at was located at Ladbroke Road, named "Bowden Court". It is a student accommodation which provides breakfast and dinner all through week days while breafast and lunch on weekends (elaborated in Food column).</p>
