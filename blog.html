        <p class="topic"> Introduction / Read Me </p>
        <p>I recommend you read the guide from top to bottom.<br>
        <span class="comment">[But who does that? When an article on Medium says "6 min read" does it really take us 6 mins? Do we even read the whole thing?]</span> Sigh! Please ignore the grey text as much as possible.</p>
        <p>I've written this guide through first hand experience and hard work. I'll be as thorough as possible, in return all I ask is for you to make this your bible for 3C.</p>
        <p>The guide has been divided into sections which you can access directly through the tags provided above.<br><span class="comment">[As if it wasn't obvious but have to make a proper documentation, you know]</span></p>
        <p id="accommodation" class="topic"> Accommodation </p>
        <p>Short version: Take an Accommodation through University Living which gives you meals. Don't take a flat.</p>
        <p>The Accommodation that I lived at was located at Ladbroke Road, named "Bowden Court". I was assigned to it by a company called University Living which is like an AirBnB company but for students and it handles student accommodations. Bowden Court is a student accommodation which provides breakfast and dinner all through week days while breakfast and lunch on weekends (elaborated in Food column). The room that I stayed in was a twin sharing with 2 single beds, 2 sets of cupboards, 2 sets of drawers (there are 3 drawers in each set, one of which has a lock), one mirror attached behind the door, a washbasin, a table, 2 chairs, a radiator and a window <span class="comment">(looked around) and a door</span>. The tapwater is drinkable and has running water 24/7 with both cold and warm water. The beds are provided with two pillows, a bedsheet and a comforter. In India, we use heaters to keep our houses warm, here, they use centralized heating using radiators. The heat from radiator can be adjusted using a knob and usually the room is really warm even though I keep the window open 24/7 for proper ventilation.<span class="comment"> I'm sitting here in a Tshirt and a hoodie while the temperature just outside the window is (I legit checked my phone) is 6 (degree symbol).</span> The room is spacious enough for two people. There are four floors on the building plus a ground floor and a basement. The rooms are more spacious on the 1st floor and the least on the 4th (IDK about the rooms on the ground floor). There are rooms for a single tenant as well (but I don't have any info on them).</p>
        <p>The food is available in the canteen on the basement. It's a pretty big canteen, more like a hostel-mess. The food is served as a buffet. It's a place to interact with other students <span class="comment"> and weirdos </span> in the accommodation. The timing and everything else is elaborated in the Food section <span class="comment">I could link the foo... [be quiet! be quiet! make a straight face] :)</span></p>
        <p>You get a number of keys and "access device" (IDK what to call it exactly). You get a key for your room door, your drawer with lock and your cupboard. The access device helps you get into the accommodation, into the main access point of rooms and into the gym. I carry the set of keys everytime I step outside the room. <span class="comment"> Boy, is it fun when your roommate forgets the keys</span></p>
        <p>Additional facilities include a TV room (with really comfy sofas and beanbags), a microwave room, a gym, a laundry room and a study room (but I've never been there). The gym is meh! You get the basic machines but a lot of necessary ones are missing including the pulley. The dumbbells go upto 20kgs. (I bought a resistance band which gives upto 25kg of resistance and that worked out fine for me). Laundry costs 3.20£ for the washing machine and 0.20£ minimum for the dryer (you add more money to it to make it run longer). </span> Sh!t's expensive round here.</span> You can get print-outs taken at the accommodation itself, and that costs 0.25£ per page (I've merely started talking about expenses).</p>
        <p>There are about 8-10 toilets and showers each, on every floor (except basement). Shared toilets I thought would be a problem but aren't. They are usually empty (not because there are less people but because <span class="comment">[who cares!?]</span> I seriously don't know and ignorance is bliss). The toilets are neat and clean. They are cleaned daily.</p><p> I hope by now you understand why I asked you to not take a flat. The challenges with living in a flat shared among friends are nothing but doable. But you're not in India. You're in a foreign country where it takes 10£ to get two visa photos clicked. You don't want to face these challenges (of making your own food, cleaning the house (oh btw they clean the room every weekday and change the covers every two weeks, here), cleaning the bathrooms, cleaning the dishes, managing groceries, need i go on?). My advise, take a student accommodation, focus only on the things you need to do<span class="comment"> and not how you clean those</span> ;)</p>
        <p>I think that covers it all. If I missed something or you have a question, please do ask me.</p>
        <p id="birkbeck" class="topic"> Birkbeck University </p>
        <p>Short version: Birkbeck University is cool. But I haven't been around it. </p>
        <p>The coolest thing about Birkbeck is that every Thursday there are food stalls in the middle of the campus under the name of Farmer's Market. You'll get the best desserts and cheeseburgers burgers there for good prices. Classes are usually on the 4th or 5th floor.</p>

            Short version:<span class="comment"> ...what classes?</span>
            <p>On a serious note, it's 10pm of 27th Jan 2019 (I landed here on 8th Jan 2019) and only a single class has happened so far. It's funny and cool when it happens in Amity, Noida, it's not so cool or funny as it happens here. My dad spent a fortune to send me here and is this how I'm supposed to pay back? <span class="comment">FCUK OFF AMITY, THIS IS NOT INDIA</span></p>

            <p id="luggage" class="topic"> Luggage </p>
            <p>Short version: The weight of luggage you can carry depends on the airline you travel through. Etihad airways permits 45kgs of check-in baggage and 7kgs in handbag.</p>
            <p>The biggest question about packing for a very long trip is what to NOT take. So, my philosophy was simple. I asked myself "What all things will I regret NOT carrying" and I put those stuff in my bag first. I brought two big suitcases and one bagpack. My suitcases together weighed about 35kgs while my handbag weighed about 6kgs. The reason I left 10kgs of space off of my luggage is coz of the stuff I'll buy during my trip. If my luggage weighed even 1kgs more than the legal limit while coming back, I would either have to pay a large sum to extend the weight to be carried or I would have to throw some of my stuff away. A good way of packing for your trip is to mark those things in your checklist which you'd use and throw (like most of the toiletry stuff) or eatables. I knew the accessibility of food is convenient in London so I didn't carry a lot of food. I had 1 ready-to-eat meal for emergencies and 2 cup-noodles. Whilst a lot of my colleagues carried a lot of Indian sweets and ready-to-eats. Honestly, the one thing I don't want when I go out is "home-food". <span class="comment">I want cheeseburger and pork and proper english desserts and more is elaborated in Food xD</span></p>
            <p id="mandate" class="topic"> Mandatory Things To Carry </p>
            <ul>
              Short version: <span class="comment">A list is the shortest version of a list. It's a goddamn list for godsake.</span><br><br>
              <li>Medicines.
                <p>Go to your doctor, get a list of medicines, buy all of those and carry them with you. London's healthcare system (NHS) is not as helpful to foreigners. You can't just walk into a drugstore and buy a medicine. You can't just call a doctor coz you are feeling feverish. Chances are you won't get sick, London is 1000 times cleaner than our "under development since 72 years, mother nation". The most that can happen is that you catch cold. Guess what, London is cold, almost everyone has a runny nose. My nose bled the first week I was here coz my nose is accustomed to the "full-of-dirt" air of India.</p></li>
              <li>Umbrella.</li>
              <li>Water Bottle.
              <p>I also carried a thermos. It fell and broke. It's not required though (warm water is readily available) but still. Sorry mum :'(</p></li>
              <li>Towel.</li>
              <li>A Notebook & Pen.
              <p><span class="comment">I cracked a laugh whilst my colleagues were buying a notebook and a pen.</span></p></li>
              <li>Moisturizer.
              <p>Your hands are gonna get dry a lot. As non-macho it may sound to not use a moisturizer, kindly, use one.</p></li>
              <li>Earphones.
              <p>I don't step outside my house without earphones, how would I survive without them in another country? I carried 2 pairs of earphones and my gaming headset which are base boosted for those times I need to really focus or zone out (you prolly say that you are better now, better now, I only say that 'cause you're not around, not around). <span class="comment">Sorry, where was I? </span></p></li>
              <li>Toilet Paper/Roll.
              <p>There are emergency situations where you might need toilet roll. And even if you don't need them, you can use those as tissues.</p></li>
              <li>An Extra Phone.
              <p>Worst case scenario, you lose a phone and you have to buy one here. Electronics are expensive here. Take an extra phone with you. <span class="comment">My dad gave me his old motorola and bought a new phone. Well played, father!</span></p></li>
              <li>Carry US Visa Photographs.
              <p>Somehow, it slipped my mind and I wasn't able to carry US visa photos. I wear glasses and for US visa, your photo needs to be without glasses. I went to about 5 photo studios and called another 5. The minimum price was offered by Royal Mail service shop and it costed me 10£ for 2 photos of 5cm x 5cm dimension. "10£". 1000Rs for 2 <span class="comment">fkin' </span>photos. I paid for it through my savings :/</p></li>
              <li>A Matrix Sim Card.
              <p>I forbid everyone reading this to travel without a matrix sim card. I paid 1500Rs, I got unlimited local (London) calling and SMS, 5Gb of monthly data (which is hardly used as there is free WiFi nearly everywhere) and 1000 minutes of calling to India. I wasn't that surprised as you guys might not be. But compared to almost all my colleagues who paid 15£ and got 500 minutes of local calling and a lot less mobile data, I was having the best condescending laugh of the time.</p></li>
              <li>Powerbank.
              <p>If you are a methodical person like me then you charge your phone everytime you enter your room. But if you are not, then carry a powerbank. Your phone is the most important asset beside your passport. Keep it alive everytime. Sadly, I bought a powerbank off of my pocket money and it's just lying in my drawer now coz I charge my phone periodically. <span class="comment">Sigh! Selling powerbank 50gp, also buying rune 2h sword and some lobster.</span></p></li>
              <li>Laptop.
              <p>I had a debate with myself about whether to put this in the list or not. Like who would be this dumb to forget the goddamn laptop at home. But then again, I'm a special snowflake whose name is usually taken in the same line as the word "exception", so well, here we are. Forgot to grey this out, lol.</p></li>
              <span class="comment"><li>Confidence.</span>
              <p><span class="comment">Confidence is key while ordering a Tall Latte at Starbucks.</span></p></li>
              <span class="comment">[Too much memes for the day, lol, imma sleep now]</span>
