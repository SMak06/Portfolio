# This would be my Portfolio/Resume website in the future.  

This website is subject to a lot of changes. A LOT. So, bear with me whilst I develop this. 

One of the major blogs for the website describing the 3 Continent program is up and running but again is not fully complete as my program hasn't even reached the half way. Although, I have addressed most of the major things that I believe are important.

Contribute to my website/blog. IDK why one would wonna contribute but if you'd like to, be my guest. If you would like to share your own experience from the 3C program, please go to the blog page and contact me over any of the several social media links I've provided. :)
